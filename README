This repository contains data and code for the analysis [reported and published](XXXXXX) by *The San Diego Union-Tribune* in 2022.

### About

Studies over the past decade have shown San Diego police stop, search and arrest people of color more often than Whites. Police officials have repeatedly said factors other than racial bias are driving the numbers. Specifically, that officers respond to crimes, emergency calls and complaints, and these are what largely drive the numbers.

The Union-Tribune analyzed police stops with calls for service and reported crimes in each beat from January 2019 through June 2021 to determine whether police stops of drivers and pedestrians are proportional to crime activity and calls for service in each neighborhood.

Ratios of stops per reported crime, people stopped per reported crime and stops per every Part 1 -- or violent -- crime were calculated to identify areas with disproportionate policing, and population data was used to identify majority-White and majority-non-White beats.

The analysis is the latest examination of crime and policing in San Diego undertaken by the Union-Tribune. 

Since 2019, the [Crime Counts](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/crime-counts) series has examined where crime occurs in city neighborhoods, and where crime has increased or decreased over the years. In 2021 The [Color of Authority](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/story/2021-03-28/the-color-of-authority-san-diego-police-sheriffs-deputies-disproportionately-target-minorities-data-show) series took a close look at RIPA data, examining who police stop, why drivers and pedestrians are stopped and how stops are conducted.

Stop data come from the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (RIPA), which requires nearly all California law enforcement agencies to submit demographic data on all detentions and searches. The Union-Tribune downloaded this stop data from the city of San Diego's [data portal](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-ripa-stops/).

Crime data was requested and obtained under the California Public Records Act.

Data containing all calls for service during the same time frame was downloaded via the city's [data portal](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-calls-for-service/).

Shapefiles for police beats were also obtained through the city's [data portal](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-beats/).

### Methodology / Notes

Since more than one individual can be involved a stop (officers are required to record the race/ethnicity of drivers and passengers) the Union-Tribune opted to analyze the race/ethnicity of each person involved, which is the same technique used by RIPA officials.

In some circumstances, officers list more than one perceived race for an individual involved in traffic stops. 

Individuals who were perceived as Hispanic and any other race were included in Hispanic totals. Individuals perceived as more than one race were categorized as those with two or more races. The remaining race categories were left the same.

Beat population data was calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2019.

The Union-Tribune aimed to identify the number of Part 1 and Part 2 crimes that occurred in each beat, as defined by the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program. Since city crime data did not carry this distinction, the Union-Tribune categorized crimes as part 1 or part 2 manually, using descriptions and code sections outlined in the [California Penal Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=667.5.&lawCode=PEN).

Stop, crime and call data files all contained rows with beat names or numbers not found in the city of San Diego's police beat shapefile. These were removed from the analyses.
